One of the big questions I have been wrestling with lately has been how the existence of aliens impacts religion. Albeit I approach this subject from the perspective of a Christian, I suspect the same issues arise with all major religions that are premised on humanity's special place in the universe.

# Premise
The kind of alien I am referring to is an extraterrestial life form that possesses the level of conciousness that we attribute to animals. Notice I did not specifiy whether this species would be more intellectual advanced than ours, because I think different philosophical questions arise depening on where on the intellect spectrum this species lies. I am going to narrow down the thought process to 2 scenarios.

# Aliens turn out to be just another animal species, except in space!

The real problem from a Christian perspective in this scenario lies with the story of Noah and The Great Flood in the Old Testament. [Genesis 7:21-23]("http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0107.htm#12") states 

>"And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth, and every man; all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, whatsoever was in the dry land, died. And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; and they were blotted out from the earth; and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.

Some don't even interpret this story literally (after all, dinosaurs were clearly not included in Noah's Ark) but rather as an allusion to the [overflooding in Mesopotamia]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth") that many other cultures refer to in their own way. However, a literal interpretation of the flood would indeed preclude the existence of aliens unless either they arose AFTER the flood or they are grouped with dinos among the beings not selected to be saved by this cataclysmic event.

If we were to take the story metaphorically as opposed to literally however, we would have a new interesting question: why were aliens spared from the flood? 

# Aliens turn out to be more or just as advanced as we are in cognitive terms
